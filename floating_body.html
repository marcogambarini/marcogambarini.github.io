<h1> Diffraction and radiation by a floating body </h1>


<p>
When simulating the effects of floating bodies on waves in a linear setting
using boundary element methods (BEM), it is customary to represent the
resulting wave elevation as the sum of incident, diffracted and radiated
waves. This was difficult for me to visualize: I have put together some
animations to hopefully make it clearer. <br>

The decomposition of wave elevation is
$$ \eta = \eta_i + \eta_d + \sum_i^{N_\text{dof}}  \eta_{r, i} \xi_i$$
where \(\eta_i\) are the incident waves, \(\eta_d\) the diffracted waves,
\(\eta_{r,i}\) the radiated waves for unit amplitude motion in the direction
of degree of freedom \(i\) and \(\xi_i\) the amplitude of the body oscillations
in the \(i\)-th degree of freedom. <br>

We will consider the case of an ideally infinitely long rectangle with its long edge parallel to
wavefronts (perpendicular to wavevectors), its short edge much smaller
than the wavelength and its thickness small compared to both other dimensions.
Such a body, as we shall see, behaves as a wave follower, that is it
rides the waves while not perturbing them much; this is hard to see from the
individual diffraction and radiation results.
</p>


<p>
Let's start with incident waves.

Let us now see the effect of diffraction: we solve the problem with the body
held fixed.

<p>
The blue line indicates incident waves, the orange one diffracted waves,
and the solid red line is the resulting field. We can see that
waves are partially reflected, forming almost standing waves in front of the
body, while behind the body the resulting waves travel with smaller amplitude
and a different phase with respect to the incident waves. This would indicate
that the body is able to attenuate incident waves very effectively.
Actually, this would be true if the body was actually fixed, but we still
have to sum the radiation contribution.

<p>
This is calculated by imposing unit oscillations to the body. Each time the body
moves down, it displaces water, generating a pair of outgoing waves. These waves
happen to almost cancel diffracted waves: here is the result.

<p>
In this last figure we can recognize all the single contributions (the colors
are the same as in the previous plots, except the red solid line is now the
full sum). The perturbation of the initial wave caused by the body is
evident, buth much smaller than predicted by the diffraction simulation.
