<h1> Diffraction and radiation by a floating body </h1>


<p>
When simulating the effects of floating bodies on waves in a linear setting
using boundary element methods (BEM), it is customary to represent the
resulting wave elevation as the sum of incident, diffracted and radiated
waves. This was difficult for me to visualize: I have put together some
animations to hopefully make it clearer. <br>

The decomposition of wave elevation is
$$ \eta = \eta_i + \eta_d + \sum_i^{N_\text{dof}}  \eta_{r, i} \xi_i$$
where \(\eta_i\) are the incident waves, \(\eta_d\) the diffracted waves,
\(\eta_{r,i}\) the radiated waves for unit amplitude motion in the direction
of degree of freedom \(i\) and \(\xi_i\) the amplitude of the body oscillations
in the \(i\)-th degree of freedom. <br>

We will consider the case of an ideally infinitely long rectangle with its long edge parallel to
wavefronts (perpendicular to wavevectors), its short edge much smaller
than the wavelength and its thickness small compared to both other dimensions.
Such a body, as we shall see, behaves as a wave follower, that is it
rides the waves while not perturbing them much; this is hard to see from the
individual diffraction and radiation results. Only vertical, or so-called
heaving, motions will be considered.
</p>


<p>
Let's start with incident waves.

We now add the effect of diffraction: the problem is solved with the body
held fixed. From this simulation, we also compute the force on the bottom
of the body: let's call it \(F_i + F_d\), that is, the force from incident
and diffracted waves.

<p>
The blue line indicates incident waves, the orange one diffracted waves,
and the solid red line is the resulting field. We can see that
waves are partially reflected, forming almost standing waves in front of the
body, while behind the body the resulting waves travel with smaller amplitude
and a different phase with respect to the incident waves. This would indicate
that the body is able to attenuate incident waves very effectively.
Actually, this would be true if the body was actually fixed, but we still
have to sum the radiation contribution. This is calculated by imposing unit oscillations to the body.
From this simulation we compute the force on the bottom and call it
\(f_r\), the radiation force per unit amplitude.

<p>
Each time the body
moves down, it displaces water, generating a pair of outgoing waves. These waves
happen to almost cancel diffracted waves, as we shall see later. Remember that
radiated waves were computed for a unit oscillation: now we need to compute
the complex amplitude \(\xi_i\) of the actual oscillation. This is done by
writing and solving the equation of motion of the body:

$$ (- M \omega^2 + K) \xi = F_i + F_d + F_r $$

We do not know the value of \(F_r\), but we know the value of force per unit
oscillation amplitude, \(f_r\), and the problem is linear, so we can write

$$ (- M \omega^2 + K + f_r) \xi = F_i + F_d $$

and solve for \(\xi\). As a sidenote, \(F_r\) is typically decomposed into
added mass and radiation damping contributions, but this is not strictly
needed to understand what happens.

<p>
In this last figure we can recognize all the single contributions (the colors
are the same as in the previous plots, except the red solid line is now the
full sum). The perturbation of the initial wave caused by the body is
evident, buth much smaller than predicted by the diffraction simulation.

These simulations were run using
<a href="https://ancell.in/capytaine/latest/">Capytaine</a>. The code is available
<a href="https://github.com/marcogambarini/marcogambarini.github.io/blob/7114a794ae5e70606655d0c6908a0146771d3f0d/code/rao_animation_lines.py">here</a>:
you could modify it to see what happens when the body is not so small
compared to the wavelength, for example. If you don't have Python installed, you can work on Colaboratory
(see how to do it <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb">here</a>).
  In this case, you must install Capytaine using the command <tt>!pip install capytaine</tt>.
